General syntax
$('selector') or jQuery('selector') : calls $ function and returns jQuery object which is an object that represents 0 or more html elements w all methods of jQuery attached to it

Basic 2 methods
.html: returns the HTML contents of selected element or the first element in a collection. Similar to the innerHTML property we previously covered.
.css: allows us to change CSS properties for a given element or elements. Similar to the style property previously discussed.
